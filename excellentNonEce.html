			   <p>
				The goals for this course are to gain a solid understanding of the following topics:
				The fundamental design, analysis, and implementation of basic data structures and algorithms.
				Principles for good program design, especially the uses of data abstraction and modular program composition.
				Basic concepts in the specification and analysis of programs.

			   The ICS course provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute programs, 
			   store information, and communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, 
			   especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves
			   as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, 
			   where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. Topics covered include: 
			   machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and 
			   optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and
			   protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.

			   <p>
			   Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the 
			   principles and practice of operating systems. The core experience is writing a small 
			   Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware 
			   simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish). Work is done in two-person teams, and 
			   team programming skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized.

			   <p>
			   This course covers the design and implementation of compiler and runtime systems for 
			   high-level languages, and examines the interaction between language design, compiler 
			   design, and runtime organization. Topics covered include lexical and syntactic analysis,
			   type-checking, program analysis, code generation and optimization, memory management, and
			   runtime organization.
